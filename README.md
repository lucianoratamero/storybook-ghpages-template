# storybook-ghpages-template

This repo is a boilerplate to deploy a storybook to gh-pages :)

It uses React and SCSS to provide a convenient way to use storybooks on Github Pages.

### For documentation

If you wish to use this template for documenting components and/or design systems, take a look at the `for-docs` branch.
